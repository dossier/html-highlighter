# HTML Highlighter

The HTML Highlighter is a JavaScript module that solves these problems:

 1. Display colorful highlights on words in a live Web page that are
    determined by either or both of these sources:
    1. User `selections` identified by a user dragging their pointer
       over a portion of a page, possibly covering multiple tags in
       the DOM tree.
    1. Machine `selections` identified by a program, which might run
       in the browser or in a server-side environment that processes
       the HTML and text of a page to decide which portions of content
       should be marked.
 1. Provide these offsets to either JavaScript or backend tools.
    [StreamCorpus Pipeline](https:/github.com/trec-kba/streamcorpus-pipeline)
    is being extended to provide translation between the relative
    offsets generated by HTML Highlighter and the absolute character
    offsets used by many backend text processing tools.
 1. Provide objects isomorphic to JavaScript's `Range` object, which
    has [character offsets relative to DOM nodes identified by Xpaths](https://github.com/dossier/html-highlighter/blob/0.1.0/src/html_highlighter.js#L1067-L1076):
```javascript
{
    start: {
        xpath: <string> // unique address to DOM node
        offset: <int> // relative character offset
    },
    end: {
        xpath: <string> // unique address to DOM node
        offset: <int> // relative character offset
    }
}
```

The inline comments and class documentation are sufficient for a JavaScript
programmer to jump in and start using this.  To see an example, you can:

```bash
    git clone git://github.com/dossier/html-highlighter
    cd html-highlighter
    $BROWSER examples/index.html
```

## Building

The command given below creates a development build which is composed of a
non-minified bundle of the HTML Highlighter library, as well as examples and
tests.  All build artifacts are placed inside the `dist` directory.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Creating a **production** build requires setting the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable to `production`.  This results in *only* the HTML Highlighter library
being built, optimized and minimized.  Everything else is omitted.

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Note that the `build` script automatically installs dependencies.


## Running tests

Tests can be executed in the browser and terminal.

### Browser

There are two ways of running tests in the browser:

```sh
$ webpack --bail && http-server dist
```

*or*

```sh
$ webpack-dev-server --bail --inline --hot --content-base=dist
```

In both cases you then need to point your browser to
`http://localhost:8080/test.html`.

### Terminal

Running tests in the terminal can be accomplished by executing the following
command:

```sh
$ npm run test
```

Note that tests relying on the `document.createRange` function are skipped due
to the fact that jsdom, the virtual DOM environment, does not provide an
implementation.
